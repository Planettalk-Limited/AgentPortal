# Referral Page Warmth & Infinite Loop Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 🔧 **Infinite Loop Fix**
**Problem**: `PhoneNumberInput` component was causing infinite re-renders due to including `onChange` callback in useEffect dependencies.

**Solution**: 
```typescript
// Before (Infinite loop)
useEffect(() => {
  onChange(fullNumber)
}, [selectedCountryCode, phoneNumber, onChange])

// After (Fixed)
useEffect(() => {
  const fullNumber = getFullPhoneNumber()
  if (fullNumber !== value) {
    onChange(fullNumber)
  }
}, [selectedCountryCode, phoneNumber])
```
