These calls are commonly included in your inclusive minute bundles from your provider. This component does not apply to use of Planet Talk Services using the 'Wi-Fi feature on the App.</li>
                  <li>c) Destination Rates: these are minute plus minute rates charged for calling the specified country and will vary depending on whether you are calling a mobile or landline. Please see the 'Rates' section of the App for the current Destination Rates as published and updated from time to time.</li>
                </ul>

              <div>
                <p>2.1 Credits purchased as a Top-up via the App are valid for 180 days from the time of purchase or the date of your last top-up within the 180 days ("Validity Period").
